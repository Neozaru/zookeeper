# Zookeeper C++ client library

## Requirements

- cmake
- boost
- cppunit

# How to Build

1) do a "ant compile_jute" from the zookeeper top level directory.
   This will create a directory named "generated".

2) Create a build directory and run cmake followed by make.

    $ mkdir build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make

3) To run all the unit tests, do:

    $ ./zktest

   You can run an individual test suite. For example, to run TestCppClient, do:

    $ ./zktest TestCppClient

   You can also specify an individual test case like this:

    $ ./zktest TestCppClient::testCreate
